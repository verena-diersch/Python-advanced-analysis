Regression Analysis, Cluster Analysis and Time Series Analysis with Python

A project of sourcing open data, and analyzing it with advanced analytical functions in Python.

This is a student project I did in my data analytics bootcamp. Using Python and the relevant libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, matplotlib, folium, sklearn, pylab, quandl) I

- conducted explorative data analysis with seaborn (correlation heatmaps etc.)
- plotted a choropleth map importing a JSON file and using folium
- performed regression analysis
- performed k-means clustering
- performed time series analysis using an API

The project brief can be found elsewhere in this repository.

The project description and final deliverable can be found in the relevant folders in this repository.

The original data can be accessed via the data folder.

Source of the data: &quot;The Index of Economic Freedom&quot; from The Heritage Foundation. It can be accessed [here](https://www.heritage.org/index/explore?view=by-region-country-year&amp;u=637862049388246293).

The presentation of the project in the form of a Tableau Storyboard is accessible [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/verena.diersch/viz/IndexofEconomicFreedomAnalysis/EvaluatingtheIndexofEconomicFreedom?publish=yes).
